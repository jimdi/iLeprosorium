// This is a custom ToolBar control, that looks like UITabBar. The reasoning behind creating such a control is that standart UITabBar can be used only within UITabBarController. The standart UIToolbar does not have labels under icons and the space between buttons is not like in UITabBar.

// Disclaimer: I do not recommend to use it all the time instead of UITabBar ! Only when appropriate.

// Advantages:

// * You can enable or disable any tab whenever you want

// * You can change the number of tabs in DKToolbar in runtime

// * You do not need to use UITabBarController to add UITabBar to your view

// * You can customize and animate DKToolbar since it is open source and it is a simple UIView
